# Fece-Detection-in-image\\

I have successfully completed the #machinelearning project on #facedetection in images with the help of #haarcascadeclassifier algorithm. 


#Haarcascade algorithm is a machine learning algorithm for object detection, especially face detection, in images. It uses Haar features to determine the likelihood of a certain point being part of an object, and #boostingalgorithms to produce a strong prediction out of a combination of weak learners. It is fast and can run in real-time, but it requires a lot of training images and sometimes may not be very accurate
